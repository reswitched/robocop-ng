    #news - Used exclusively for updates on ReSwitched progress and community information. Most major announcements are passed through this channel and whenever something is posted there it's usually something you'll want to look at.

    #switch-hacking-meta - For "meta-discussion" related to hacking the switch. This is where we talk *about* the switch hacking that's going on, and where you can get clarification about the hacks that exist and the work that's being done.

    #user-support - End-user focused support, mainly between users. Ask your questions about using switch homebrew here.

    #tool-support - Developer focused support. Ask your questions about using PegaSwitch, libtransistor, Mephisto, and other tools here.

    #hack-n-all - General hacking, hardware and software development channel for hacking on things *other* than the switch. This is a great place to ask about hacking other systems-- and for the community to have technical discussions.

    #switch-hacking-general - Channel for everyone working on hacking the switch-- both in an exploit and a low-level hardware sense. This is where a lot of our in-the-open development goes on. Note that this isn't the place for developing homebrew-- we have #homebrew-development for that!

    #homebrew-development - Discussion about the development of homebrew goes there. Feel free to show off your latest creation here.

    #off-topic - Channel for discussion of anything that doesn't belong in #general. Anything goes, so long as you make sure to follow the rules and be on your best behavior.

    #toolchain-development - Discussion about the development of libtransistor itself goes there.

    #cfw-development - Development discussion regarding custom firmware (CFW) projects, such as AtmosphÃ¨re. This channel is meant for the discussion accompanying active development.
